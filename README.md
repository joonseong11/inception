# Inception
Inception is a 42 project focused on learning Docker and Docker Compose. The objective is to create a small network of three Docker containers: one for Nginx, one for WordPress, and one for MariaDB. These containers must interact over the Docker network to serve a local website.

## How to run?
To launch this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository and navigate into it:

```
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```

2. In the srcs folder, fill out the ExampleEnvFile and save it as srcs/.env.

3. Edit the login variable in the Makefile to reflect your 42 school login.

4. Build and launch the Docker containers using make:

```make```

5. The website should be accessible at `https://localhost` or `http://<your_login>.42.fr` (replace `<your_login>` with the value in the Makefile).
